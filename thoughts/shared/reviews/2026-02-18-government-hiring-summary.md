# Government Hiring Strategy Summary

**Date**: 2026-02-18
**Target**: US Government Agencies (AI Engineer Hiring)
**Your Edge**: Accessibility-first, security-aware, plain language communicator

---

## The Key Insight

Government agencies in 2026 aren't looking for the flashiest, trendiest engineer. They need someone who understands:

1. **Accessibility is non-negotiable** (Section 508, WCAG 2.1 AA)
2. **Security is everything** (FedRAMP, audit trails, data sovereignty)
3. **Plain language matters** (clarity over cleverness)
4. **Reliability beats novelty** (boring works, flashy fails)
5. **Legacy systems exist** (empathy for incremental modernization)

**Most AI engineers chase trends. You can be the one who delivers compliance + reliability.**

## Your Signature Positioning

### Resume/LinkedIn Headline
```
Accessibility-First AI Engineer | Section 508/WCAG 2.1 AA | FedRAMP-Familiar |
Plain Language Advocate | Legacy Modernization
```

### Portfolio Tagline
```
"Reliable, accessible, secure—built for real user needs, not novelty."
```

### 30-Second Pitch
```
"I build tools that work for everyone, including users with disabilities.

Government tech isn't about chasing the latest framework—it's about
reliability, accessibility, and meeting real user needs.

I lead with Section 508 compliance, ship with VPAT® documentation,
and design for keyboard-only navigation. That's what makes me different."

## What Makes You Different

| Most AI Engineers | You |
|-------------------|-----|
| Chase novelty (confetti, dark mode) | Accessibility-first (Section 508) |
| Treat a11y as afterthought | WCAG 2.1 AA built-in, not bolted-on |
| Use jargon ("synthesize", "optimize") | Plain language ("group notes") |
| Greenfield-only mindset | Legacy empathy (incremental migration) |
| Security as afterthought | FedRAMP-aligned, audit trails |
| "Look at this cool feature" | "This works for everyone" |

## Demo Script (Government-Focused)

```
"This collab board demonstrates three things government agencies need:

1. Accessibility-first design (Section 508, WCAG 2.1 AA)
2. Real-time collaboration with audit trails (FedRAMP-aligned)
3. AI that's transparent and controllable (no black boxes)

[Keyboard-only demo]
"I'll navigate entirely with keyboard. Notice the visible focus indicators—
required for Section 508 compliance."

[Command palette demo]
"Press `/` for commands—no mouse needed. This isn't just power UX,
it's accessibility."

[Timeline demo]
"Activity timeline provides audit trail. Every action logged, attributable,
timestamped. FedRAMP requirement."

[AI transparency demo]
"Here's how AI commands work. Data flow documented, no black boxes.
Agencies need to know what's happening with their data."

"This isn't about chasing trends. It's about reliable, accessible,
secure tools that work for everyone. That's what I bring."
```
