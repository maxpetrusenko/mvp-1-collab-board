# CollabBoard AI Demo Script

## Scene 1: Intro (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Landing page with sign-in button
**Avatar**: "Hi, I'm Max from the Gauntlet G4 team. This week, we built CollabBoard AI — a real-time collaborative whiteboard with AI-powered board automation."

## Scene 2: Auth + Board (20 seconds)
**Visual**: Google OAuth sign-in → Board loads
**Avatar**: "Users sign in with Google OAuth. The board loads instantly with an infinite canvas that supports smooth pan and zoom."

## Scene 3: Object Creation (40 seconds)
**Visual**: Create sticky note → Edit text → Create rectangle → Drag objects
**Avatar**: "Creating content is simple. Add sticky notes with one click. Double-click to edit text. Create rectangles and other shapes. Drag objects freely — our local-state optimization keeps everything smooth even during Firestore sync."

## Scene 4: Realtime Collaboration (40 seconds)
**Visual**: Split screen showing 2 browsers → Cursors moving → Object syncing
**Avatar**: "Here's where it gets powerful. Two users can collaborate in real-time. You see each other's cursors with name labels. When one user creates or moves an object, it instantly appears for everyone. Our Last-Write-Wins conflict model handles simultaneous edits gracefully."

## Scene 5: AI Commands (40 seconds)
**Visual**: Type "create a SWOT template" → 4 quadrants appear → "arrange in grid" → reorganizes
**Avatar**: "The AI board agent understands natural language commands. Ask for a SWOT template, and it creates a four-quadrant layout instantly. Request a grid arrangement, and it organizes all sticky notes automatically. Six command types are supported: creation, manipulation, layout, templates, color changes, and more."

## Scene 6: Architecture + Tech Stack (30 seconds)
**Visual**: Show GitHub repo → PRD/MVP docs → E2E tests passing
**Avatar**: "Built with React, Konva for canvas rendering, and Firebase for real-time sync. Our documentation is comprehensive — PRD, MVP specs, decision logs, and automated E2E tests. Everything ships as Firebase Functions for zero-infrastructure deployment."

## Scene 7: Outro (10 seconds)
**Visual**: Final board view → URL on screen → @GauntletAI tag
**Avatar**: "CollabBoard AI: multiplayer collaboration meets intelligent automation. Check it out at the link below. Built for Gauntlet Cohort G4."
